libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and
encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (Vorbis and Speex).

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a
lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in
files, they are commonly encapsulated in Ogg to produce Ogg Vorbis
and Speex files.

The src/ directory contains the source code.
The src/libfishsound/ directory has the library source code.
The src/tools/ directory has some command line tools showing 
               how to program with libfishsound.
 
The include/ directory contains the libsishound include files that
will be installed into the system include directory.
  
The doc/ directory contains some documentation for libfishsound. The
subdirectory libfishsound is autocreated by doxygen from comments
contained in the source code.
  
The win32/ directory contains the files necessary to compile the
library for MS Windows.
  
This library is installed using the standard configure, make, make
install sequence. Full details in the file INSTALL.
  
Read the file README.win32 for installing under MS Windows.
